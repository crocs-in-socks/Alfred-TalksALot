So, with some experience now, I've come to realise and appreciate the enormous amount of difficult work that goes behind natural language processing and I feel this is a bit beyond my wheelhouse at the present. As such, I'm pivoting and using the newly released chatGPT API as my natural language processor to reply as the virtual assistant.

Besides this, I plan to add file searching features and other custom commands to flesh out the assistant.
